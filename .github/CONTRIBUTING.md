# How to contribute

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Aerogear project. We want
keep this process as easy as possible so we've outlined a few guidelines below. 
For more information about the Aerogear project, visit 
[our website](http://aerogear.org/).

## Asking for help

Whether you're contributing a new feature or bug fix, or simply submitting a
ticket, the Aerogear team is available for technical advice or feedback. 
You can reach us at #aerogear on [Freenode IRC](https://freenode.net/) or the 
[aerogear-dev list](http://lists.jboss.org/pipermail/aerogear-dev/)
-- both are actively monitored.

## Getting started

* Make sure you have a [JIRA account](https://issues.jboss.org)
* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Submit a ticket for your issue to the 
[Aerogear project](https://issues.jboss.org/projects/FH/), assuming one does 
not already exist.
  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
  * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.
* Fork the repository on GitHub.

## Making changes

* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
  * This is usually the master branch.
  * To quickly create a topic branch based on master; `git checkout -b
    <branch name> master`. By convention we typically include the JIRA issue 
    key in the branch name, e.g. `FH-1234-my-feature`.
  * Please avoid working directly on the `master` branch.
* Make commits of logical units.
* Prepend your commit messages with a JIRA ticket number, e.g. "FH-1234: Fix
  spelling mistake in README."
* Follow the coding style in use.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
* Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.
* Run _all_ the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.

## Submitting changes

* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a pull request to the repository in the [Aerogear GitHub organization]
  (https://github.com/aerogear) and choose branch you want to patch 
  (usually master). 
  * Advanced users may want to install the [GitHub CLI](https://hub.github.com/) 
    and use the `hub pull-request` command.
* Update your JIRA ticket to mark that you have submitted code and are ready 
for it to be reviewed (Status: Dev Complete).
  * Include a link to the pull request in the ticket.
* Add detail about the change to the pull request including screenshots 
  if the change affects the UI.

## Reviewing changes

* After submitting a pull request, one of Aerogear team members will review it.
* Changes may be requested to conform to our style guide and internal 
  requirements.
* When the changes are approved and all tests are passing, a Aerogear team
  member will merge them.
* Note: if you have write access to the repository, do not directly merge pull 
  requests. Let another team member review your pull request and approve it.

## Coding best practices

We have compiled a set of best practices for each programming
language we use. View them [here](https://github.com/fheng/best_practice).
